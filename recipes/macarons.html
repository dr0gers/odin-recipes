        <ol>
        <li>Combine confectioner's sugar, almond flour, and 1.2 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food
            processor. Pulse a few times until extra-fine. Sift through a fine-mest sieve into a large
            bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Beat egg shites with the reamining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cream of tartar in the bowl
            of a stand mixer fitted with a wisk attachment until frothy. Gradually add superfine
            sugar and vanilla and continue to beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Do
            not overbeat; tips of peaks should hold their shape but curl over slightly.
        </li>
        <li>Gently flod 1.3 of the almond flour mixture into the egg whites, turning bowl
            occasionally, until nearly combined. Drop in food coloring. Add remaining almond
            flour mixture in 2 additions, gently folding until a batter comes together. Batter
            should fall off the spatula in thick ribbions without breaking.
        </li>

            sheets with silicon macaron mats. Pipe batter into each circle on the mats. Tap
            baking sheets 4 times against the counter to release any air bubbles. Let macarons sit
            at room temperature until dry to the touch, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degress F (150 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Bake mcaracons in teh preheated over until bottoms rise slightly off the mats to form
            "feet", 17 to 20 minutes. Switch baking sheets' positions halfway through.
        </li>
        <li>Let macarons cool on the mats for 15 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool
            completely, at least 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat butter and confectioners' sugar together using an electric mixer until
            creamy, Add heavy cream and vanilla extract; beat until combined.
